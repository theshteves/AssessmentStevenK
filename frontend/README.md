# Frontend Assessment

The frontend assessment is broken up into two sections:
* Section 1: HTML & CSS
* Section 2: JavaScript DOM Manipulation

## Section 1 Instructions:
There are two images (`section1-mvp.png` & `section1-full.png`) on of an mvp and one of a full features request. Try to replicate at least the MVP, optional to do the full one.
  * You can use whatever libraries and frameworks you need.
  * Put your code in `section 1` folder
  Note: The messages should be scrollable on the full feature one
